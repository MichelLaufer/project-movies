# Project Movies

In this project at the Technigo bootcamp, we have built our first multi-page React application. The goal was to use [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/)'s API to fetch a list of movies, display them on a page and then link to a movie detail page when you click on the movie.
