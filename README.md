# Project Movies ðŸŽ¬ðŸŽ¬ðŸŽ¬

In this project at the Technigo bootcamp, we have built our first multi-page React application. The goal was to use [themoviedb.org]'s API to fetch a list of movies, display them on a page and then link to a movie detail page when you click on the movie.

I used React Router, useState and useEffect. 

I added a dropdown at the start page where the user could choose between displaying a list of "popular", "upcoming" or "top rated" movies. I also included a component called "showSimilar" which would display a list of "similar" movies to the one on the movie detail page if the user would click on "Show Similar". If I had more time I would add additional information for each movie, e.g. genres.
